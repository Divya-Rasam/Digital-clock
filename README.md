# Digital-Clock
 I have made a digital clock having some features in it. like you can get time, day, date and temperature in my city, ie. in Mumbai.
 I used HTML and CSS for the layout of the whole page, with that to make the clock work I implemented Javascript.
 I have mainly used the date function to get date, current day and time, implemented setTimeout to update the clock ever second.
 Also lastly, I used the fetch function to get the temperature api key and applied it to get the temperature in Mumbai through the longitude and latitude values.
